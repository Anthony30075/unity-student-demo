# SimpleFighter.cs - Fixed Version

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Animation System Unified
**Before:** Mixed approach using boolean parameters AND direct `animator.Play()` calls
**After:** All animations now use `animator.Play()` exclusively
- Removed all boolean parameter constants (paramIdle, paramWalk, etc.)
- Removed `SetAnimBool()` method
- Simplified `UpdateStateAnimation()` to directly play animation clips
- **Animator Setup:** Simply create an Animator Controller with states named exactly as your AnimationClip names

### ✅ 2. Sprite Facing Fixed
**Before:** Fighter never visually flipped when changing direction
**After:** Added `UpdateSpriteFacing()` method
- Added `spriteRenderer` field to cache the SpriteRenderer component
- Uses `spriteRenderer.flipX` to flip the sprite based on `faceRight` boolean
- Called every frame in `Update()`

### ✅ 3. Unity API Compatibility Fixed
**Before:** Used `rb.linearVelocity` (Unity 6+ only)
**After:** Changed to `rb.velocity` for compatibility with Unity 2019-2023+
- Fixed in 5 locations throughout the script
- Now works with Unity 2019.4, 2020.3, 2021.3, 2022.3, 2023.x, and Unity 6+

### ✅ 4. Health Bar Positioning Fixed
**Before:** Health bar was child of fighter transform, rotated with fighter
**After:** Health bar in world space, follows fighter position
- Changed `healthBarRoot` to have no parent (world space)
- Added position update in `UpdateHealthBar()` every frame
- Health bar now stays upright and properly positioned
- Left-aligned fill bar for proper drain effect

### ✅ 5. Memory Leak Fixed
**Before:** Created new Texture2D every time `CreateSimpleSprite()` was called
**After:** Reuses single `healthBarTexture` field
- Added `healthBarTexture` field to cache the texture
- Only creates texture once
- Properly destroys texture in `OnDestroy()`

### ✅ 6. Validation Enhanced
**Before:** Missing validation for SpriteRenderer
**After:** Added validation check for SpriteRenderer component
- Will show clear error message if SpriteRenderer is missing

## How to Use

### Required Animator Controller Setup:
1. Create an Animator Controller
2. Add states with names matching your AnimationClip names:
   - Idle, Walk, Jump, Fall, Dash, Hitstun, KO (state animations)
   - Plus your attack animation names (light/medium/heavy)
3. **No parameters needed!** Script uses `animator.Play()` directly

### Required Components on GameObject:
- Rigidbody2D (2D physics)
- Collider2D (for hit detection)
- Animator (for animations)
- SpriteRenderer (on GameObject or any child)

### Inspector Setup:
All fields marked REQUIRED must be configured:
- Identity: Fighter name
- Controls: 7 keycodes (left, right, jump, dash, light, medium, heavy)
- Movement: All movement parameters > 0, plus groundMask and groundCheck settings
- Attacks: 3 attacks with all required fields
- Vitals: maxHP > 0
- Health Bar: Sprite, offsets, scales, and colors
- State Animations: 7 animation clips (idle, walk, jump, fall, dash, hitstun, KO)
