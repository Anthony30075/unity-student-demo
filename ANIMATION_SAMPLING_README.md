# Animation Sampling Implementation

## Overview
The `BasicFighter2D` script has been updated to use **direct AnimationClip sampling** instead of relying on the Unity Animator. This approach drives the SpriteRenderer by sampling animation clips frame-by-frame, which works in both play mode and edit mode.

## What Changed

### 1. **Added Debug Flag**
- New public field: `debugAnimations` (bool, default: false)
- When enabled, logs detailed information about animation playback
- Helps track which animations are playing and when they loop

### 2. **Animation Sampling System**
The script now uses `AnimationClip.SampleAnimation()` to directly apply animation data to the GameObject:

**Key Components:**
- `currentClip` - The currently playing animation clip
- `animationTime` - Current playback time in the clip
- `loopCurrentClip` - Whether the animation should loop
- `SampleCurrentAnimation()` - Called every frame to advance and sample the clip

### 3. **Removed Animator Dependency**
- Animator component is no longer required (optional)
- Removed animator state validation checks
- No need to create animator controllers with matching state names
- Animation clips can be assigned directly in the inspector

### 4. **How It Works**

```
Update() 
  → UpdateStateAnimation()  // Selects appropriate clip based on state
  → SampleCurrentAnimation() // Advances time and samples the clip
```

**Sampling Process:**
1. Advances `animationTime` by `Time.deltaTime`
2. Handles looping (wraps time or clamps to end)
3. Calls `currentClip.SampleAnimation(gameObject, animationTime)`
4. Unity applies the animation data to SpriteRenderer

### 5. **Debug Output**

When `debugAnimations = true`, you'll see logs like:

```
[FighterName] Animation system initialized. Using clip sampling mode.
[FighterName] Playing clip: Idle, Loop: True
[FighterName] Looping clip: Idle
[FighterName] Sampling Idle at time 0.45/1.00
[FighterName] Playing attack animation: Light (LightAttack)
```

## Usage Instructions

### In Unity Inspector:

1. **Assign Animation Clips** to the script:
   - animIdle
   - animWalk
   - animJump
   - animFall
   - animDash
   - animHitstun
   - animKO
   - Attack animations (in lightAttack.anim, mediumAttack.anim, heavyAttack.anim)

2. **Enable Debug Mode** (optional):
   - Check "Debug Animations" to see detailed logs

3. **Remove or Disable Animator** (optional):
   - The Animator component is no longer needed
   - You can remove it or leave it disabled

### Testing:

1. Enable `debugAnimations` in the inspector
2. Run the game
3. Check the Console for animation logs:
   - Which clips are playing
   - When animations loop
   - Time progress every 60 frames

## Technical Details

### Animation Looping
- **State animations** (Idle, Walk, Jump, etc.): Loop continuously
- **Attack animations**: Play once (no loop)
- **KO animation**: Plays once and holds on last frame

### Editor Mode Compatibility
The code includes `#if UNITY_EDITOR` blocks to handle sampling in edit mode, though the primary use case is runtime play mode.

### Performance
- `SampleAnimation()` is called every frame
- Debug logs are throttled (every 60 frames) to avoid spam
- No animator overhead or state machine processing

## Troubleshooting

### Animations not playing?
1. Check `debugAnimations = true` and look at Console logs
2. Verify all animation clips are assigned in inspector
3. Ensure clips have sprite animation data
4. Check that SpriteRenderer is present on GameObject or child

### Debug logs showing warnings?
- "No current clip to sample" = Animation clip not assigned
- "Attempted to play null clip" = Missing clip reference
- Check all required animation fields are filled

## Benefits

✅ **Simpler Setup** - No need for animator controllers  
✅ **Direct Control** - Sample exactly what frame you want  
✅ **Editor Compatible** - Works in edit mode  
✅ **Debugging** - Clear logs show exactly what's happening  
✅ **Lightweight** - No animator state machine overhead  

## Limitations

⚠️ **No Blending** - Instant transitions (no crossfade)  
⚠️ **Manual Control** - No built-in transition logic  
⚠️ **Play Mode Focus** - Primarily designed for runtime use  

---

**Note:** All existing public variables remain unchanged. The system is backwards compatible with existing setups - you just need to assign the animation clips.
